abstract: I provide a model uncertainty foundation to the power certainty equivalent
  of Epstein-Zin-Weil risk sensitive preferences (EZ), enabling the analysis of these
  preferences using detection probabilities (DEPs) and worst case models. This completes
  the connection between these preferences and the model uncertainty of Hansen and
  Sargent (2007) (HS) that was previously limited to the special case of unit elasticity
  of intertemporal substitution. The connection between EZ and HS rests on a powerlike
  extension of entropy and its associated statistics from Tsallis (1988) and I show
  that the same additional margin of pessimism that implies this connection can close
  the gap to the empirical Sharpe ratio in a more general specification. For the specific
  cases of EZ and HS preferences, I find that calibrations that match detection error
  probabilities yield comparable asset pricing implications across models. Surprisingly,
  I find that the low levels of risk aversion with EZ preferences that match asset
  pricing facts are associated with a high level of model uncertainty in the long
  run risk environment of Bansal and Yaron (2004).
