abstract: This paper contains a solution and an estimation method for linear rational-expectations
  models with lagged expectations. The solution method is a synthetic approach, combining
  state-space and infinite-MA representations with a simple system of linear equations.
  The advantage lies in the particular combination of methods from the literature,
  providing faster execution, more general applicability, and more straightforward
  usage than existing algorithms. Bayesian estimation methods are employed without
  the Kalman filter using a recursive algorithm to evaluate the likelihood function
  and are used to compare small-scale sticky-information and sticky-price DSGE models.
  Standard truncation methods are shown to not generally be innocuous.
