abstract: We prove that the undetermined Taylor series coefficients of local approximations
  to the policy function of arbitrary order in a wide class of discrete time dynamic
  stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are solvable by standard DSGE perturbation
  methods under regularity and saddle point stability assumptions on first order approximations.
  Extending the approach to nonstationary models, we provide necessary and sufficient
  conditions for solvability, as well as an example in the neoclassical growth model
  where solvability fails. Finally, we eliminate the assumption of solvability needed
  for the local existence theorem of perturbation solutions, complete the proof that
  the policy function is invariant to first order changes in risk, and attribute the
  loss of numerical accuracy in progressively higher order terms to the compounding
  of errors from the first order transition matrix.
