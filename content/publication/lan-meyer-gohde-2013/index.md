abstract: We propose a nonlinear infinite moving average as an alternative to the
  standard state space policy function for solving nonlinear DSGE models. Perturbation
  of the nonlinear moving average policy function provides a direct mapping from a
  history of innovations to endogenous variables, decomposes the contributions from
  individual orders of uncertainty and nonlinearity, and enables familiar impulse
  response analysis in nonlinear settings. When the linear approximation is saddle
  stable and free of unit roots, higher order terms are likewise saddle stable and
  first order corrections for uncertainty are zero. We derive the third order approximation
  explicitly, examine the accuracy of the method using Euler equation tests, and compare
  with state space approximations.
