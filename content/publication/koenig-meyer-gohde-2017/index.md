abstract: We revisit Ball and Romer’s (1990) canonical model of price setting with
  menu costs that exhibits multiple equilibria. We show that changes to firms’ markups
  move nominal and real rigidities in opposite directions. Using game-theoretic tools
  to derive a unique equilibrium, we find that accounting for agents’ endogenous adjustment
  of price expectations further weakens the link between real and nominal rigidities.
