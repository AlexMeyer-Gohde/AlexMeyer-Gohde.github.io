abstract: This paper presents and compares Newton-based methods from the applied mathematics
  literature for solving the matrix quadratic that underlies the recursive solution
  of linear DSGE models. The methods are compared using nearly 100 different models
  from the Macroeconomic Model Data Base (MMB) and different parameterizations of
  the monetary policy rule in the medium-scale New Keynesian model of Smets and Wouters
  (2007) iteratively. We find that Newton-based methods compare favorably in solving
  DSGE models, providing higher accuracy as measured by the forward error of the solution
  at a comparable computation burden. The methods, however, suffer from their inability
  to guarantee convergence to a particular, e.g. unique stable, solution, but their
  iterative procedures lend themselves to refining solutions either from different
  methods or parameterizations.
