I am a committed researcher and educator in <b>macroeconomics</b> with a deep-seated passion for its intersection with <b>financial markets</b> and <b>numerical methods</b>. Currently serving as a professor at the Goethe Universität Frankfurt and the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability, my research endeavors are aimed at dissecting the methodological underpinnings of macroeconomics. My focus is on the effects of risk and uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics, market frictions, and the interaction with monetary policy and my contributions have been recognized with publications such as in the Journal of Economic Theory and grants with the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Originating from the United States, my academic journey began with a bachelor's degree from Colorado State University and culminated in a doctorate from the Technische Universität Berlin. Having lived and worked in various German cities such as Hamburg, Berlin, and Potsdam before settling in Frankfurt in 2018, my experiences have not only shaped my academic perspective but have also fostered my blend of theoretical rigor and quantitative analysis.
