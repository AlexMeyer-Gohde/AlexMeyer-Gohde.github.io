<b>Winter Semester 2024</b>
Digitalization in Monetary Policy, Banking Supervision, and Financial Stability

Digitalization is pervasive, influencing almost every aspect of modern society. The supervision and stability of the financial sector and the communication and implementation of monetary policy are no different. Examples include potential and problems with publically accessible forecasts and forecasting models, liability and potential of machine learning in informing policy, large language models and monetary policy communication.

The interdisciplinary seminar will examine various aspects of digitalization and the associated challenges for monetary policy and supervision as well as its consequences for financial stability from an economic and legal perspective.

<b>Winter Semester 2023</b>
Green Finance: Monetary Policy and Banking Supervision

Climate change is influencing the structures of the financial sector and both the goals and transmission of monetary policy. Examples include certification and regulation of ESG criteria, mandates and quotas of portfolio components certified accordingly, and a longer than business cycle perspective in the conduct of monetary policy.

The interdisciplinary seminar aims to examine various facets of this transformation and the associated challenges for monetary policy as well as for supervision from an economic and legal perspective.

<b>Winter Semester 2022</b>
Economic and Legal Aspects of Virtual Currencies 

The digital transformation is influencing the structures of the financial sector through technical innovations, but above all through data-driven business models and changed social practices, such as payment habits. Examples of this transformation include the increasing proliferation of different forms of cryptocurrencies, and, on the other hand, considerations by central banks to issue digital central bank money. This transformation is sometimes characterized as a change in the nature of money. 

The interdisciplinary seminar aims to examine various facets of this transformation and the associated challenges for monetary policy as well as for supervision from an economic and legal perspective.
