This course will introduce students to the rigorous solution, estimation, and analysis of business cycle modelsNumerical solution methods will be compared in the analysis of the real business cycle (RBC) model and numerical estimation techniques introduced in the analysis of New Keynesian models. Thus, the course will have a twofold focus on models and techniques.
