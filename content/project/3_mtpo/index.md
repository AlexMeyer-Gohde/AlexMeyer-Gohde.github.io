This course introduces students to the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used in modern monetary macroeconomics called New Keynesian models at the master's level. The basic model equations including nominal frictions such as price stickiness are derived carefully, and model solution techniques are discussed. Numerical solutions of the models are obtained and the models are simulated and analyzed using Dynare in MATLAB. Possible extensions to the core model that may be treated in class include an analysis of optimal monetary policy and the accelerator mechanism.

After completing the course, students should understand the dynamic mechanisms of nominal rigidities and the policy tradeoffs facing monetary policy.  Mechanically, students will be able to derive, solve and simulate simple DSGE models and should be able to read and understand more elaborate models found in the literature.
