The course introduces students to two modern theories of business cycles: Real Business Cycle theory and New Keynesian theory. A standard Real Business Cycle model will be formally stated and solved. Afterwards, a standard New Keynesian model will be formally stated and solved. Finally, we use these two models for policy analysis. Students learn how to state and solve modern business cycle models.
