This course will introduce students to the foundations of Bayesian estimation in the context of macroeconomics. A rigorous treatment of the principles of Bayesian estimation and contrast with frequentist techniques will form the foundations to application to reduced-form and structural models of the macroeconomy. Topics such as linear regression, VAR, and DSGE models will be examined through the Bayesian perspective.
