abstract={Determinacy bounds provide the limits on monetary policy's reaction function that rule out self fulfilling equilibria. In standard sticky price analyses, these bounds are generically nonlinear functions of model parameters and all the coefficients in this reaction function. We examine a collection of alternative models with nominal rigidities driven by different informational inertia but all having in common a vertical long Phillips curve. These models share the same determinacy bounds, independent of model specific parameters and dependent only on monetary policy's reaction to inflation. This reaction must be more than one for one - that is, the celebrated Taylor principle is shown to be necessary and not just sufficient if the long run Phillips curve is vertical - no amount of output targeting can substitute for this concern of the monetary authority for inflation.},
