abstract: The term structure of interest rates is crucial for the transmission of
  monetary policy to financial markets and the macroeconomy. Disentangling the impact
  of monetary policy on the components of interest rates, expected short rates, and
  term premia is essential to understanding this channel. To accomplish this, we provide
  a quantitative structural model with endogenous, time‐varying term premia that are
  consistent with empirical findings. News about future policy, in contrast to unexpected
  policy shocks, has quantitatively significant effects on term premia along the entire
  term structure. This provides a plausible explanation for partly contradictory estimates
  in the empirical literature.
