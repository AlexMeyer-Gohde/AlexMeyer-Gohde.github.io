  abstract = {This paper presents and compares Newton-based methods from the applied mathematics literature for solving the matrix quadratic that underlies the recursive solution of linear DSGE models. The methods are compared using nearly 100 different models from the Macroeconomic Model Data Base (MMB) and different parameterizations of the monetary policy rule in the medium-scale New Keynesian model of Smets and Wouters (2007) iteratively. We find that Newton-based methods compare favorably in solving DSGE models, providing higher accuracy as measured by the forward error of the solution at a comparable computation burden. The methods, however, suffer from their inability to guarantee convergence to a particular, e.g. unique stable, solution, but their iterative procedures lend themselves to refining solutions either from different methods or parameterizations.}

  abstract={The term structure of interest rates is crucial for the transmission of monetary policy to financial markets and the macroeconomy. Disentangling the impact of monetary policy on the components of interest rates, expected short rates, and term premia is essential to understanding this channel. To accomplish this, we provide a quantitative structural model with endogenous, time‐varying term premia that are consistent with empirical findings. News about future policy, in contrast to unexpected policy shocks, has quantitatively significant effects on term premia along the entire term structure. This provides a plausible explanation for partly contradictory estimates in the empirical literature.},

  abstract={I provide a model uncertainty foundation to the power certainty equivalent of Epstein-Zin-Weil risk sensitive preferences (EZ), enabling the analysis of these preferences using detection probabilities (DEPs) and worst case models. This completes the connection between these preferences and the model uncertainty of Hansen and Sargent (2007) (HS) that was previously limited to the special case of unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The connection between EZ and HS rests on a powerlike extension of entropy and its associated statistics from Tsallis (1988) and I show that the same additional margin of pessimism that implies this connection can close the gap to the empirical Sharpe ratio in a more general specification. For the specific cases of EZ and HS preferences, I find that calibrations that match detection error probabilities yield comparable asset pricing implications across models. Surprisingly, I find that the low levels of risk aversion with EZ preferences that match asset pricing facts are associated with a high level of model uncertainty in the long run risk environment of Bansal and Yaron (2004).},

Extending the approach to nonstationary models, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability, as well as an example in the neoclassical growth model where solvability fails. Finally, we eliminate the assumption of solvability needed for the local existence theorem of perturbation solutions, complete the proof that the policy function is invariant to first order changes in risk, and attribute the loss of numerical accuracy in progressively higher order terms to the compounding of errors from the first order transition matrix.},

  abstract={We propose a nonlinear infinite moving average as an alternative to the standard state space policy function for solving nonlinear DSGE models. Perturbation of the nonlinear moving average policy function provides a direct mapping from a history of innovations to endogenous variables, decomposes the contributions from individual orders of uncertainty and nonlinearity, and enables familiar impulse response analysis in nonlinear settings. When the linear approximation is saddle stable and free of unit roots, higher order terms are likewise saddle stable and first order corrections for uncertainty are zero. We derive the third order approximation explicitly, examine the accuracy of the method using Euler equation tests, and compare with state space approximations.},

  abstract={This paper contains a solution and an estimation method for linear rational-expectations models with lagged expectations. The solution method is a synthetic approach, combining state-space and infinite-MA representations with a simple system of linear equations. The advantage lies in the particular combination of methods from the literature, providing faster execution, more general applicability, and more straightforward usage than existing algorithms. Bayesian estimation methods are employed without the Kalman filter using a recursive algorithm to evaluate the likelihood function and are used to compare small-scale sticky-information and sticky-price DSGE models. Standard truncation methods are shown to not generally be innocuous.},
